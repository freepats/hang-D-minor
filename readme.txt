Hang tuned in D minor
---------------------

Version 2022-03-30

The Hang is a pitched percussion instrument, made of steel and commonly played
with the hands. This sounds have been created from a hang tuned in D minor.
Thanks to Mar who kindly let us record her hang for the FreePats project and
was the performer during the recording session.

It was recorded on July 2017, at the Medialab-Prado auditorium in Madrid
(Spain), by Gonzalo <humanogonzalo@gmail.com> and Roberto
<roberto@zenvoid.org>, using a Zoom H1 portable recorder mounted on a tripod.

The raw recordings were cropped, edited, and processed by Roberto, using free
software programs.

This sound bank contains the same notes than the real instrument: A3, C4, D4,
E4, F4, G4, A4, Bb4, C5, D5. Other notes are silent. Unlike other sound banks,
we shouldn't fill missing in-between semitones by varying the pitch of nearby
notes, due to the fixed harmonic sounds produced by the hang. When one note of
the hang is played, all other notes resonate in background, creating a
characteristic warm compound sound (tuned in D minor in this particular case).
If the frequency of one note is shifted, its background chords would be
shifted as well to random scales.

This sound bank, in several formats and qualities, is available on the
FreePats project web pages:
